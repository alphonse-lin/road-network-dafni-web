Problem Statement
Urban transportation networks are increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events, particularly flooding. The escalation of flood events has become more frequent and devastating, largely driven by climate change and rising sea levels[1]. Current approaches to traffic management during floods face three critical limitations [2]. First, traditional congestion risk assessments rely on static network characteristics, failing to capture the dynamic nature of flood progression and its impact on network topology. Second, there exists a significant gap in integrating flood modelling with temporal network property measurements, limiting our understanding of how traffic disruptions cascade through the system. Third, existing systems lack the capability to predict and respond to flood-induced congestion in real-time, leading to delayed responses and inefficient resource allocation during critical periods.
Theoretical Framework
We propose a novel hierarchical four-module framework for assessing dynamic congestion risks in transportation networks under flooding conditions: Our framework(Figure 1) begins with the Data and Context Layer that integrates road networks, commuter behaviours, and flood maps to provide a comprehensive foundation for analysis. The Computation Layer processes this data to generate context-based betweenness centrality as a static indicator of road segment importance and dynamic exposure flag series that track flood impacts on the network. The Integration Layer synthesizes these computations into two parallel analytical streams: topological structure analysis generating dynamic context-based betweenness centrality, and transportation system analysis producing time-variant traffic demand series. This dual approach captures both structural and functional aspects of network performance under flooding. The Evaluation Layer generates time-variant vulnerability index series that measure the network's dynamic susceptibility to disruption, and time-variant congestion risk maps that visualize the evolving patterns of traffic congestion risk during flood events. These outputs enable spatial-temporal understanding of how congestion risks develop and propagate under flooding. The novelty of our approach lies in its ability to capture the temporal evolution of network vulnerability while integrating both structural and functional perspectives of transportation system performance. Unlike traditional methods that provide static snapshots, our framework offers continuous monitoring of network dynamics during flood events, enabling more effective and timely interventions.

Case Study
We validated our framework using central London's urban road network (29.5 km², 7,820 road segments), simulating a one-hour rainfall event (50 mm/h) with two hours of post-rainfall response(Figure 2a-e). The analysis revealed that as flooding progressed, significant changes in betweenness centrality distribution emerged (Figure 2f), reflecting dynamic redistribution of traffic across remaining operational roads.
 
Figure 2 Multi-layer data integration and dynamic network analysis distribution map
For transportation system analysis, we employed MATSim to model traffic flow under flooding conditions. We generated travel activity chains based on building functions, population demographics, and land use data, representing daily mobility patterns of virtual commuters. During simulation, road segments with inundation depths exceeding 0.3m were automatically closed to traffic, forcing adaptive routing as commuters sought alternative paths. We conducted simulations across three time periods (morning peak, off-peak, and evening peak) to capture varying traffic demands (Figure 3). Using Dynamic Time Warping, we aligned traffic demand with betweenness centrality series to identify critical vulnerability points. Morning peak analysis showed global network properties dominated (61.24%) with secondary roads becoming particularly vulnerable, while off-peak periods (12:00 pm) exhibited stronger global perspective (77.6%) and more resilient network performance during flooding. 
 
Figure 3 Comparative analysis of normal and flood-disrupted traffic demand patterns
Building on our vulnerability analysis, we developed time-variant congestion risk maps that visualize traffic disruption evolution during flooding, categorizing risk based on the interplay between topological vulnerability and traffic demand changes. As shown in Figure 4a, these maps reveal distinct spatial-temporal patterns across different times of day. The morning rush hour (7:30 am) shows increasing high and highest congestion risks concentrated in secondary roads as flooding progresses. The midday period (12:00 pm) displays remarkable resilience with predominantly low congestion risk levels, while evening rush hour (4:30 pm) exhibits the most severe congestion patterns concentrated along arterial roads. Our classification system identifies four risk levels: lowest (decreasing vulnerability and demand), low (increasing vulnerability, decreasing demand), high (decreasing vulnerability, increasing demand), and highest (increasing vulnerability and demand). Figure 4b quantifies these patterns, showing the fluctuating number of road segments at each risk level over the two-hour simulation period. This approach enables traffic managers to prioritize interventions based on both timing and location, optimizing resource allocation during flood events.

Applications and Impact
 
Figure 5 Dynamic flood-induced traffic congestion risk assessment platform
Our framework has been implemented as a functional web-based platform (Figure 5) with four key components: a home page for area selection, topological structure analysis for betweenness centrality visualization, transportation system analysis for traffic demand simulation, and evaluation indices displaying vulnerability and congestion risk maps. This platform advances urban infrastructure management across three key domains: For emergency response, it enables proactive congestion mitigation through early identification of high-risk areas, allowing traffic managers to implement targeted interventions before critical thresholds are reached. In infrastructure planning, it identifies critical road segments consistently vulnerable to flooding, helping engineers prioritize improvements such as elevated roadways or improved drainage systems. The platform also serves as an educational tool for stakeholders, visualizing complex flood-traffic interactions and facilitating intuitive understanding of system behaviour under stress. Future enhancements will integrate real-time sensor data, expand to multimodal transportation analysis, and develop automated response recommendations.

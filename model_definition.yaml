  summary: A platform for assessing the impact of flooding on urban transportation networks and traffic congestion
  description: >
    A comprehensive platform for assessing the dynamic impact of flooding on urban transportation networks.
    It integrates road networks, commuter behaviors, and flood maps to generate vulnerability indices and congestion risk maps.

    The platform employs a four-layer methodology: data context, computation, integration, and evaluation,
    providing a holistic approach to understanding how flooding affects traffic congestion.
    
    Key outputs include road vulnerability indices, traffic flow patterns, and network topology metrics that
    help decision-makers identify critical infrastructure and plan effective flood response strategies.
